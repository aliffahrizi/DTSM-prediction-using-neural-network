Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a neural network using Python and relevant machine learning libraries.

Features

Data preprocessing: Handles input features and labels for training.

Model construction: Builds a neural network architecture using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).

Training: Includes a training loop with loss calculation and optimizer.

Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, or loss.

Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)

- Jupyter Notebook

- TensorFlow

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Pandas

Installation
