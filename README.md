# Neural Network for Predicting DTSM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a neural network using Python and relevant machine learning libraries.

## Features

Data preprocessing: Handles input features and labels for training.

Model construction: Builds a neural network architecture using a deep learning framework.

Training: Includes a training loop with loss calculation and optimizer.

Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, or loss.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- TensorFlow

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Pandas

## Installation

### Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/aliffahrizi/DTSM-prediction-using-neural-network.git

### Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

### Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook neural_network.ipynb

### Run the notebook cells sequentially to:

1. Preprocess data

2. Build and compile the model

3. Train the model

4. Evaluate the model's performance

## File Structure

- Neural_network.ipynb: The main notebook containing code and explanations.

- requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the notebook.

- plot.py: a python code functions i create to visualize the logs.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of training and validation metrics, such as:

- Training and validation loss over epochs, and

- Evaluation metrics such as R2 score, MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
